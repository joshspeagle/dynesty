This is an internal memo for things that need to be done for the release

Essential steps for the release (order is important):

* update the changelog.md and changelog in the docs
* change the internal version number ( py/dynesty/_version.py )
* git tag
* release on pypi and github (Note it may not be a good idea to make a release on github,
as I believe that creates one more zenodo record )

Things to check before the release

Docs:
* Make sure the docs are up to date with the changes
* make sure readthedocs are building
* refresh AUTHORS.md
* refresh citation information if needed in dynesty.py, docs and readme
* add a zenodo record (if a major version)

Testing
* Double check serious pylint warnings
```
pylint --fail-under=8 --extension-pkg-whitelist=scipy.special --disable=R,C
```
* Make sure the tests run (ideally for many random seeds)
```
for a in `seq 0 35` ; do env OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 DYNESTY_TEST_RANDOMSEED=$a PYTHONPATH=py:tests:$PYTHONPATH pytest -m 'not slow'  > /tmp/ulog.${a}  & done
```
* Run the slow tests (i.e. pytest without -m 'not slow')
* Make sure that the jupyter notebooks run with the latest release i.e. with this
```
 env OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 PYTHONPATH=py:tests:$PYTHONPATH  pytest  --workers=100 tests/test_notebooks.py
```
It may be also needed to update the actual .ipynb files in the repo (and/or look at the results)
