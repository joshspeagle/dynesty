**The release paper describing the code corresponding to dynesty 1.0 can be found**
`here <https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty/tree/master/paper/dynesty.pdf>`_.
Since recent dynesty versions have significant changes with respect to the paper, unless
you use the 1.0 version, you must *also* cite dynesty code used through `zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3348367>`_


A list of papers that you should cite can always be generated directly
from the `sampler` object by calling::

    print(sampler.citations)

This will return a list of relevant papers and corresponding links to download
citation information such as BibTex files.

This list will by default include the following papers:

* Code:
  `Speagle (2020) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.3132S/abstract>`_
  and `Koposov et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3348367>`_
  
* Nested Sampling:
  `Skilling (2004) <http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AIPC..735..395S>`_
  and `Skilling (2006) <https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1340370944>`_.

If you use the Dynamic Nested Sampling functionality
(via `DynamicNestedSampler`), this will also include:

* Dynamic Nested Sampling:
  `Higson et al. (2019)
  <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-018-9844-0>`_.

Depending on your specific bounding and sampling options, this may also include
the following papers:

If you have utilized some of the error analysis features available through
the provided utility functions (see :ref:`Nested Sampling Errors`),
you should also cite:

Code
====

``dynesty`` is the spiritual successor to Nested Sampling package `nestle 
<http://kylebarbary.com/nestle/>`_ and has benefited enormously from the work
put in by `Kyle Barbary <http://kylebarbary.com/>`_ and  `other contributors 
<https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty/blob/master/AUTHORS.md>`_.

Much of the API is inspired by the ensemble MCMC package
`emcee <https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ as well as other work by
`Daniel Foreman-Mackey <http://dfm.io/>`_.

Many of the plotting utilities draw heavily upon Daniel Foreman-Mackey's
wonderful `corner <http://corner.readthedocs.io>`_ package.

Several other plotting utilities as well as the real-time status outputs are
inspired in part by features available in the statistical modeling package
`PyMC3 <https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/index.html>`_.
